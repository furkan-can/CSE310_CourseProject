# The Thief Detector

In an environment where security measures are thought to be low, we thought that the need for security could be met by using Raspberry-Pi technology without the need for very complex systems. We decided to name our project "The Thief Detector". The purpose of our project is to take a photo of the environment and notify it to the predetermined e-mail address in case of motion detection outside the expectations in the environment where Raspberry is placed, and then save the environment photo to firebase. (The system will do this itself). In this way, the system owner using the mobile application can access the data saved in firebase. Thus, when the system detects motion, it will both send a picture to the specified e-mail address and save it to the firebase database, allowing us to access it from the mobile application.
